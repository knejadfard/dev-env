# dev-env
A collection of various scripts, configuration files, etc. for my personal development environment(s)

## Vim
First and foremost, it is important to configure Vim. The .vimrc file in this repository has general settings that can be applied for Vim without any 3rd party plugins. However, it also has sections that are only specific to plugins, and therefore, applying them requires you to have the plugin installed. I use Vundle to install and manage Vim plugins.
